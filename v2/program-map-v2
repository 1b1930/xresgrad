1. ask user which color to make gradients of

2. open xresources file

3. extract color from line depending on user choice
	3.1 make sure to support the same syntaxes the xresources file sypports

4. function to calculate darker or lighter variant of the extracted hex color. this is gonna be a pain.
	4.1 i should take this opportunity to learn some math aka the algorithm used to do this
	4.2 i probably won't do that.

5. for loop to create a increasingly darker or lighter variant of the colors
	5.1 is there a way to do this without opening and closing the file every time? probably not

6. remember to comment religiously so you can fix bugs later instead of writing it from scratch again you ffffffuck
